Chapter 4: 30 Jun 2026 — The Invisible Enemy: Cosmic Bit Flips

moksh-qos-dev | Mission: Quantum OS & AI Hypervised Kernel

    "A single rogue neutron can bring down a digital empire."

We established that Medusa must survive radiation. But what does radiation actually do to code?

In the real world, space agencies face an enemy called a Single Event Upset (SEU). When cosmic rays or high-energy neutrons strike a silicon chip, they carry enough electrical charge to flip a transistor. A binary 0 suddenly becomes a 1 in the system's memory.

If that 0 was part of your video game, a pixel flashes the wrong color. If that 0 was part of your kernel's memory allocation table, the entire system instantly suffers a fatal crash.

How do we build a hypervisor that survives this?

    ECC (Error-Correcting Code) Memory: Hardware that uses extra parity bits to detect and mathematically fix single-bit errors on the fly.

    Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR): The hypervisor runs the exact same calculation across three isolated cores. If a cosmic ray hits one core and changes the answer, the hypervisor holds a "vote." The two cores that agree outvote the mutated one, and the system survives.

Medusa’s foundation must assume that the hardware beneath it is constantly under attack by the universe itself.

Day 3 logged. 1456 to go.
